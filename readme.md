
## Objective
The main Objective behind this simple shiny app is to make it easier to locate blood banks in Tamil Nadu State of India along with the pincodes, addresses, contact person name and number, which will help the general Public.



## Data:
Data for the blood bank application is sourced from [Open Government Data Platform](https://data.gov.in/). The Original Data was filtered for Tamil Nadu State alone. The original data is available as a csv file called "Blood Bank Directory (updated Till Last Month)". The raw data file, processed data file and my shiny code is made available on my github.



## Data limitation
One of the limitations of this application is that the data is not completely accurate. There are close to 14 NA values for latitude and longitude.

Hence when we create the shiny application we will ignore these points.



## Help:
In case you observe the data projected on map has discrepancies and you have more accurate or additional information that could be updated it will be great if you can email me and i will update the same.
